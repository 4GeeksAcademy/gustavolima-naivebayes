# Naive Bayes Modeling for ML

Naive Bayes is a great model to work with for Binomial issues (Yes / No, True / False) but it can also handle Multinomial problems especially when data is not discrete.

This problem used a playstore app review / feedback dataset to try and understand what causes an user to give you a good or bad rating. Using Naive Bayes with both Binomial and Multinomial with included boosting, our best result indeed was with a Bernoulli (Binomial) model, our data was discrete, so I decided to follow with the Multinomial, non-gaussian, model for the predictive model.
